Brainfuck language transpiler to Emacs Lisp

** Usage

The brainfuck language transpiler to Emacs Lisp consists of ~ebf~
macro which expands to the actual Emacs Lisp code. Here is the
signature of this macro:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(ebf INPUT-CALLBACK OUTPUT-CALLBACK &rest INSTRUCTIONS)

#+END_SRC

~INPUT-CALLBACK~ is called on dot instruction and should have zero
arguments and return a number. ~OUTPUT-CALLBACK~ is called on comman
instruction and should have one argument of an integer
type. ~INSTRUCTIONS~ is a list of symbols which names are sequences of
brainfuck instructions.

So the code

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ebf nil nil +++\[->+<\])
#+END_SRC

will be expanded to

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((G31336 (make-vector 100 0))
      (G31337 0))
  (cl-incf (aref G31336 G31337))
  (cl-incf (aref G31336 G31337))
  (cl-incf (aref G31336 G31337))
  (while (not (zerop (aref G31336 G31337)))
    (cl-decf (aref G31336 G31337))
    (cl-incf G31337)
    (cl-incf (aref G31336 G31337))
    (cl-decf G31337)))
#+END_SRC

As you can see we don't do any optimizations and have a memory
limitation. But we are working on that.

Here is the classical Hello World example with some output:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((result nil))
  (ebf nil #'(lambda (x) (setq result (cons x result)))
       ++++++++++\[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-\]>++
       .>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.
       ------.--------.>+.>.)
  (apply #'string (reverse result)));<- put cursor here and press C-x C-e
#+END_SRC
